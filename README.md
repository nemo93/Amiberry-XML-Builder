# About The Amiberry XML Builder 
The Amiberry XML Builder is an automated tool which will routinely scan for available Amiga WHDLoad Packs (Games) and pre-set 
various options to be used in conjunction with the [Amiga emulator Amiberry](https://github.com/midwan/amiberry) to aid with games 
compatibility and usability. This tool will be storing the end results in an output XML file named after 
[whdload_db.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nemo93/Amiberry-XML-Builder/master/whdload_db.xml).

If the above sounds like another language, or makes no sense, please consider visiting https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/wiki to 
learn more about why this tool exists.
